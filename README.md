Libraries Used
pandas:

A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in reading, processing, and writing data in tabular form.
Used here to read data from an Excel file and perform operations on the DataFrame (a tabular data structure).
openpyxl:

A library for working with Excel files. It allows reading and writing Excel files in .xlsx format.
Required for pandas to interact with Excel files.
üõ†Ô∏è Key Functions in My Code
pd.read_excel(input_file):

Reads data from an Excel file into a DataFrame.
This allows us to manipulate the data programmatically.
Custom Function process_name(name):

A function I wrote to handle name processing:
Checks for Deceased Status: If (Deceased) is present, it removes this marker and flags the person as deceased.
Splits the Name: Separates the full name into first name, middle name, last name, and suffix based on common patterns.
Suffix Handling: Detects common suffixes like Jr., Sr., III, etc., and assigns them correctly.
apply() Method:

Applies the custom function to each value in the "Name" column of the DataFrame.
Creates new columns for each processed component.
df.to_excel(output_file):

Saves the processed data back into a new Excel file, preserving the output for further use.
üìù Note on Names
All the names used in this example are fictional and included solely for educational purposes. They do not represent any actual individuals.

Python and its libraries like pandas and openpyxl are excellent tools for automating repetitive tasks, like processing large datasets in Excel files.
Writing custom functions enables flexibility to handle complex patterns in real-world data.
The project not only demonstrated Python's power but also provided an opportunity to refine my skills in data analysis.
